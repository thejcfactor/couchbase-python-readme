# Prerequisites<a id="prerequisites"></a>

- [Couchbase Server](http://couchbase.com/download)
- You may need a C compiler and Python development files, unless a
  binary wheel is available for your platform. Currently, wheels are only available on Windows for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. We will endeavor to add more.
- Git, if a binary wheel is not available.

>**NOTE:** Currently the Python Client source distribution requires the OpenSSL headers and libraries that the Python client itself was built against to be installed prior to the client itself for TLS support to be provided. Additionally the installer relies on PEP517 which older versions of PIP do not support. If you experience issues installing it is advised to upgrade your PIP/setuptools installation as follows:<br>
>```console
>python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
>```

## Debian and Ubuntu<a id="pre-deb-ubuntu"></a>

First-time setup:
```console
$ sudo apt install git-all python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools cmake build-essential
```

For TLS/SSL support:
```console
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

## RHEL and CentOS<a id="pre-rhel-centos"></a>

First-time setup:
```console
$ sudo yum install git-all gcc gcc-c++ python3-devel python3-pip python3-setuptools cmake
```

>**NOTE:** The minimum version of CMake support is 3.5.1.  Check out the steps [here](https://idroot.us/install-cmake-centos-8/) to update CMake.

For TLS/SSL support:
```console
$ sudo yum install openssl-devel
```

## Mac OS X<a id="pre-macos"></a>

It is not recommended to use the vendor-supplied Python that ships with OS X. Best practice is to use a Python virtual environment such as pyenv or venv (after another version of Python that is not vendor-supplied has been installed) to manage multiple versions of Python.

>:exclamation:**IMPORTANT**:exclamation:<br>There can be a problem when using the Python (3.8.2) that ships with Xcode on Catalina.  It is advised to use one of the following:
>- [pyenv](#macos-pyenv)
>- [Homebrew](#macos-homebrew)
>- Install Python via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads)

### pyenv<a id="macos-pyenv"></a>

See detailed walk through in [Appendix](#appendix-pyenv).  Also, see pyenv install [docs](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos) for further details.

### Homebrew<a id="macos-homebrew"></a>

See Homebrew install [docs](https://brew.sh/) for further details.

```

>**NOTE:** It is possible that installing or updating to the the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download) is needed.

If setuptools is not installed:
```console
$ python -m pip install setuptools
```

### Windows<a id="building-windows"></a>
#### Requirements
- Download and install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= v 3.5.1
- Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Download and install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    + Check *Desktop development with C++* prior to installing
- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### VS2019 Notes

If seeing issues when trying to build (steps in [](#)), some things to check/try:
- Try running the build commands within the visual studio developer command line
- Make sure *MSBuild* can find the correct *VCTargetsPath*
    + It is possible the *VCTargetsPath* environment variable needs to be set.  The below example is based on a typical path, but the actual setting should match that of your current environment setup.
        * ```set VCTargetsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v160```
- Make sure *CMake* is picking up the correct generator
    + It is possible the *CMAKE_GENERATOR* environment variable needs to be set
        * ```set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 16 2019```

#### VS2015 & VS2017 Notes

While it is possible to use VS2015 or VS2017 build tools, it is recommended to use the VS2019 path.  Some things to note if using the VS2015 or VS2017:
- Make sure *CMake* is picking up the correct generator
    + It is possible the *CMAKE_GENERATOR* environment variable needs to be set
        * VS2015 example:  ```set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 14 2015```
- Make sure *MSBuild* can be found
    + It is possible an environment variable needs to be set
- Make sure the correct [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive/) is installed
- Make sure *MSBuild* can find the correct *VCTargetsPath*
    + It is possible the *VCTargetsPath* environment variable needs to be set.  The below example is based on a typical path, but the actual setting should match that of your current environment setup.
        * ```set VCTargetsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\v140```
- MSBuild can run into [issues with MAX_PATH limits](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/53#issuecomment-459062618) when using ```python -m pip install couchbase```.  This isn't fixed until MSBuild 16.0 so it is recommended to move to VS2019 (comes with MSBuild 16.0).

## Build the Python SDK
Clone this Python SDK repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client.git
```

Move into the directory created after cloning the Python SDK repository:
```console
cd couchbase-python-client
```

The following will compile the module locally:
```console
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

If you have a libcouchbase install already (in, for example, /opt/local/libcouchbase), you may build using it by setting PYCBC_BUILD=DISTUTILS and some add extra directives, like so:
```console
$ export PYCBC_BUILD=DISTUTILS
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace \
    --library-dir /opt/local/libcouchbase/lib \
    --include-dir /opt/local/libcouchbase/include
```

You can also modify the environment ```CFLAGS``` and ```LDFLAGS``` variables.

>:exclamation:**WARNING:** If you do not intend to install this module, ensure you set the ```PYTHONPATH``` environment variable to this directory before running any scripts depending on it. Failing to do so may result in your script running against an older version of this module (if installed), or throwing an exception stating that the ```couchbase``` module could not be found.

## Install
```console
pip install .
```

>:exclamation:**WARNING:** If you are on Mac OS X you may need to remove the build directory: ```rm -rf ./build``` before installing with pip: ```pip3 install .```.

# Using the SDK<a id="using-the-sdk"></a>

## Connecting<a id="sdk-connecting"></a>

See [official documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html) for further details on connecting.

```python
# needed for any cluster connection
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster, ClusterOptions
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator

# needed to support SQL++ (N1QL) query
from couchbase.cluster import QueryOptions

# get a reference to our cluster
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost', ClusterOptions(
  PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password')))
```

>**NOTE:** Authentication is handled differently depending on what version of Couchbase Server you are using.  In Couchbase Server >= 5.0, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides discrete username and passwords for an application that allow fine-grained control. The authenticator is always required.

## Basic Operations<a id="sdk-basic-ops"></a>

See official documentation for further details on [Working with Data](https://docs.couchbase.com/python-sdk/current/howtos/kv-operations.html).

Building upon the example code in the [Connecting](#sdk-connecting) section:

```python
# get a reference to our bucket
cb = cluster.bucket('travel-sample')

# get a reference to the default collection
cb_coll = cb.default_collection()

# get a document
result = cb_coll.get('airline_8091')
print(result.content_as[dict])

# using SQL++ (a.k.a N1QL)
sql_query = 'SELECT VALUE name FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airline" AND callsign = $1'
row_iter = cluster.query(sql_query, QueryOptions(positional_parameters=[cs]))
for row in row_iter: 
    print(row)
```

## Async Operations<a id="sdk-async-ops"></a>
The Python Couchbase SDK supports asynchronous I/O through the use of the asyncio (Python standard library) or the Twisted async framework.

>**NOTE:** The gcouchbase API has been omitted for the 3.x version.

### Asyncio

To use asyncio, import ```acouchbase.cluster``` instead of ```couchbase.cluster```.  The ```acouchbase``` API offers an API similar to the ```couchbase``` API.

```python
import asyncio

from acouchbase.cluster import Cluster, get_event_loop
from couchbase.cluster import ClusterOptions
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator


async def write_and_read(key, value):
    cluster = Cluster(
        connection_string='couchbase://localhost',
        options=ClusterOptions(
        authenticator=PasswordAuthenticator("Administrator","password")))
    cb = cluster.bucket("test")
    await cb.on_connect()
    cb_coll = cb.default_collection()
    await cb_coll.upsert(key, value)
    return await cb_coll.get(key)

loop = get_event_loop()
rv = loop.run_until_complete(write_and_read('foo', 'bar'))
print(rv.content)
```
### Twisted

To use with Twisted, import ```txcouchbase.cluster``` instead of ```couchbase.cluster```.  The ```txcouchbase``` API offers an API similar to the ```couchbase``` API.

```python
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

from txcouchbase.cluster import TxCluster
from couchbase.auth import PasswordAuthenticator


def after_upsert(res, key, d):
    print("Set key.  Result CAS: ", res.cas)
    # trigger get_document callback
    d.callback(key)

def upsert_document(key, doc):
    d = defer.Deferred()
    res = cb.upsert(key, doc)
    res.addCallback(after_upsert, key, d)
    return d

def on_get(res, _type=str):
    print("Got res: \n", res.content_as[_type])
    reactor.stop()

def get_document(key):
    res = cb.get(key)
    res.addCallback(on_get)


# create a cluster object
cluster = TxCluster(connection_string='couchbase://localhost',
                    authenticator=PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password'))

# create a bucket object
bucket = cluster.bucket('beer-sample')
# create a collection object
cb = bucket.default_collection()

key = 'testDoc_1'
d = cb.upsert(key, {'id': 1, 'type': 'testDoc', 'info': 'fake document'})
d.addCallback(get_document, key)

reactor.run()

```
# Building Documentation<a id="building-documentation"></a>

The documentation is using Sphinx and also needs the numpydoc Sphinx extension. In order for the documentation to build properly, the C extension must have been built, since there are embedded docstrings in there as well.

To build the documentation, go into the docs directory and run:
```console
make html
```
The HTML output can be found in docs/build/html/.

Alternatively, you can also build the documentation (after building the module itself) from the top-level directory:
```console
python setup.py build_sphinx
```

Once built, the docs will be in in build/sphinx/html.

# Testing<a id="testing"></a>

For running the tests, you need the standard unittest module, shipped with Python. Additionally, the testresources package is required.

To run them, use either py.test, unittest or trial.

The tests need a running Couchbase instance. For this, a tests.ini file must be present, containing various connection parameters. An example of this file may be found in tests.ini.sample. You may copy this file to tests.ini and modify the values as needed.

To run the tests:
```console
nosetests
```
